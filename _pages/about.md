I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor (VAP) at Georgia Institute of Technology (GT). 

Prior to this, I received both my Ph.D. and B.Sc. from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). 

I was also a Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Singapore (NUS).


My research interests lie in graph theory, combinatorics, and related areas.
